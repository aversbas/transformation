        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                
        <p>The document contains a test problem for applicants, a short introduction into DocBook
            and many links to resources where you can learn more about technologies
            you are supposed to work with: XML, XSLT, HTML and so on.</p>
                
        <p>The test problem contains a few levels. We assume that a few days
            should be enough to learn all required technologies and develop a solution
            for the test problem. In case you complete this work faster then you can
            implement solutions for optional and bonus tasks. The more levels you
            complete, the better your chances are.</p>
            

    
        <h2>Problem description</h2>
        <p>The final goal of the test problem is to create an XSLT
            transformation which converts an XML document into HTML document. With the
            test problem description you get the source of this document in the XML
            format, or strictly speaking in DocBook, which is semantic markup language
            for technical documentation.</p>
        <p>Chapters below contain a brief description of several DocBook
            elements (or group of elements) and a few examples, thus you can easily
            use this document to test your transformation.</p>
            
        <h2>DocBook elements catalog</h2>
        <p>This chapter contains descriptions of the most commonly used DocBook
            elements with samples. We don't consider structural elements like
            ,  or , since for
            the test problem we chose only the  element.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Paragraph element</h2>
            <p>Element name: .</p>
            <p>Description: the  element represents a
                    paragraph in the document. Usually this element is rendered as a block
                    with padding before and after it.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
                    eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
                    minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
                    aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
                    reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
                    pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
                    culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>
            <h2>Ordered list element</h2>
            <p>Element name: .</p>
            <p>Description: ordered list is a list of items where each list
                    item is marked with a number. Ordered lists can be used for describing
                    a procedure which contains a number of steps. Ordered list is marked
                    with  element. Every list item in the list is
                    represented by the  element. Content of each list
                    item is wrapped by a  element. Besides, the
                     element may also contain an optional
                     element in the beginning to describe the content of
                    the list.</p>
            <p>Examples.</p>
            <p>The following list is a simple ordered list with four items. By
                    default Arabic numbers are used to mark list items.</p>
            <p>The next list has a specific list intro element and 3 steps.
                    List intro is a block level element (similar to paragraph) and should
                    be appropriately indented (user should see that description
                    corresponds to the list).</p>
            <p>List elements can contain different block/inline level elements.
                    The following list has several different elements inside every item.
                    Such example of content shouldn't be a problem if your transformation
                    is flexible and expandable.</p>
            <h2>Unordered list element</h2>
            <p>Element name: .</p>
            <p>Description: the  element is used to
                    add a simple unordered list to the document. Each list item is
                    represented by a single  element. All list item
                    content is wrapped by a single  element. Also a list
                    may contain an optional para element at the beginning to describe
                    contents of the list.</p>
            <p>Formatting: the list should be rendered as a simple bulleted
                    list. When a list intro element is available it should be properly
                    indented to let user see that it is a part of the list.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <p>Simple unordered list that contains four items:</p>
                                
            <li>

            <h2>Internal links</h2>
            <p>Element name: .</p>
            <p>Description: the  element is used to organize
                    links to other parts of the document. Links are organized using the
                     attribute. Each DocBook element can have an
                     attribute. To create a link to the particular element
                    the  attribute value of the 
                    element should contain the same value as the  attribute
                    of the target element. The text within the  element
                    is the link text.</p>
            <p>Formatting: the links text should be rendered with underlined
                    font in green color.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Please click  to
                    go to the Introduction chapter.</p>
            <p>Links without a correct target set, like , should be highlighted but
                    shouldn't take the reader to another place.</p>
            <h2>External links</h2>
            <p>Element name: .</p>
            <p>Description: the  element is used to organize
                    links to external resources, e.g. websites. The 
                    attribute of the  element should contain an URL of a
                    site.</p>
            <p>Formatting: the link text should be rendered with underlined
                    font in green color.</p>

            <h2>Optional link elements task</h2>
            <p>In addition to the general links handling, implement
                     attribute support. The 
                    attribute specifies the location of the text that should be used as a
                    link label.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following link -  - should have a
                    label with text "Inline elements".</p>
            <p>It would also be nice to add support of rendering other inline
                    elements inside links (e.g. ,
                    ).</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following link -  - should be rendered using
                    corresponding fonts.</p>

        <h2>Bonus tasks</h2>
        <p>If you manage to complete the basic level transformation faster,
            here you can find a few bonus tasks. The complexity of bonus tasks
            is increased, so it makes sense to work on them in the provided
            order.</p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>It doesn't matter which XSLT processor you use. However, we want to
            let you know that we are working in the Java environment and use Saxon
            XSLT processor in most of our projects.</p>
        <p>It would be nice if you provide a simple Ant build which allows you
            to run a transformation.</p>
            
        <h2>Acceptance criteria</h2>
        <p>The acceptance procedure is very simple. We run you transformation
            to transform the source of this document, then review the resulting HTML
            document.</p>
        <p>The transformation should be completed without errors. The resulting
            document should contain all the contents of the original document
            formatted accordingly.</p>
            
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>This chapter contains links to various useful resources you may need
            to learn more about XML, XSLT, HTML and others. You can use any
            information sources you like (not listed here), but we decided to share
